#Mono and XBMControl Evo installation in Windows

To be able to run XBMControl Evo in Windows you'll need to install [http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.8-1.win32.msi GTK-sharp] for Windows (about 10MB). Which can be seen as a .NET2.0 interface extension.

After installation of GTK#, simply run the XBMControl Evo installer as you're used to.
